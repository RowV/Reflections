What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
After initialisation git metadata is created and it will start keeping track
of all files in that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is part of git and working directory contains the files with latest commit. Repository contains 
all the history of the files that tracked.
