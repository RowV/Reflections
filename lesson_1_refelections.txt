This is the first file i created in SVC course. I am excited
to learn the new stuff for my software developement.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
The version control will save the file with different version. So if i do any mistake or 
go back in time and access that file it will save my time. An di dont have to worry about it
anymore. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
manual commit is better as it leaves some degree of control on when to commit and commits will be executable.
Google doc versions are great on the non code files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git saves multiple files when the different files are related to each other. Google doc doesnt have 
setting for relating the files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all the commits we made whic also dispalys the ID for commit, git diff show the changes in 
color and shows the added and deleted lines.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
reverting with the checkout can jump betwen form different commits without me having to tarck the file personally. 
It will show the modifications with color which help to debug faster.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I will use it for developing arduino programs.
